# Bitefight-Bot-Demo
A free-to-use program to automate the never-ending story mode in Bitefight, written in Java and combined with Selenium library for automating web tests.
It opens a new Google Chrome browser instance and it clicks through pages similar to a legit user.

## Download and setup
- download 'bot_v1.06.rar' package, 
- extract its content into any folder (recommended to extract package to a place where administrator permissions are NOT required, e.g. Desktop), 
- and follow instructions given in 'instructions.txt' to setup and run bot.

## Current version:

25.5.2018 --> v1.05
* bot now detects EU cookies compliance message (introduced on 23.5.2018)
