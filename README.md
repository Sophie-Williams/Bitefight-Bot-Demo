# Bitefight-Bot-Demo
An automated remote control program (bot) for a popular browser game Bitefight, written in Java combined with Selenium library for automating tests. So far, only story mode is supported. 

<instructions.txt> in both BOT_Chrome.zip and BOT_Chrome_Scrolling.zip contain instructions to run bot.

Both BOT_Chrome.rar and BOT_Chrome_Scrolling.rar packages contain:
- Java executable bot program
- Google Chrome WebDriver (chromedriver.exe v2.35 for Windows, can use any other version for any other OS) 
- few txt documents. 

Bot program in BOT_Chrome_Scrolling.zip contains an additional "manual" mousewheel scrolling
in case the original bot program in BOT_Chrome.zip does not scroll on pages automatically.
