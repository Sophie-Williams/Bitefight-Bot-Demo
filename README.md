# Bitefight-Bot-Demo
Automated remote control program (bot) for a popular browser game Bitefight, written in Java combined with Selenium library for automating tests. So far, only story mode and leveling aspects is supported. 

<instructions.txt> in .zip packages conntain instructions how to configure and run bot.

all .zip packages contain:
- Java executable bot program
- Google Chrome WebDriver (chromedriver.exe v2.35 for Windows, can use any other version for any other OS) 
- few txt documents. 

differences:
* BOT_Chrome.zip --> basic bot
* BOT_Chrome_Scrolling.zip --> added "manual" mousewheel scrolling in case the basic bot does not scroll on pages automatically
* BOT_Chrome_Aspects.zip --> helps you level or reorganize your wanted aspects
